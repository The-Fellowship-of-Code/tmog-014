# The Mirror of Galadriel!
## Episode #014 - Container With Most Water

Welcome to ***The Mirror of Galadriel***, one of the activities that will follow in the *The Fellowship of Code*. If you haven't been here before, this is a place where programming problems of different types will be proposed to be solved as fast as possible.

Without further ado, we leave you with the next problem. 

Good luck adventurers!

## Statement

You are given an integer array ``height`` of length ``n``. There are ``n`` vertical lines drawn such that the two endpoints of the ``i^th`` line are ``(i, 0)`` and ``(i, height[i])``.

Find two lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most water.

Return _the maximum amount of water a container can store._

**Notice** that you may not slant the container.

***Constraints***
> ``n == height.length``.
> </br>``2 <= n <= 10^5``
> </br>``0 <= height[i] <= 10^4``

## Examples

*Example 1*
> ![example1](https://s3-lc-upload.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/2018/07/17/question_11.jpg)
> </br> **Input**: height = [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]
> </br> **Output**: 49
> </br> **Explanation**: The above vertical lines are represented by array [1,8,6,2,5,4,8,3,7]. In this case, the max area of water (blue section) the container can contain is 49.

*Example 2*
> **Input**: height = [1,1]
> </br> **Output**: 1

## Extra

Run, you fools! No extra spicy stuff this time.
